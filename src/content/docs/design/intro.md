# Design System

The RCI Design System is the single source of truth for our user interface and visual language. It ensures that all our digital products—from the main International Hub to local section blogs—feel like part of the same revolutionary family.

Our aesthetic is defined as **"Revolutionary Utilitarianism"**. It is bold, urgent, and clear, avoiding unnecessary decoration in favor of impactful typography and strong contrast.

## Core Principles

### 1. Content is King
The message of the International is paramount. Design should never distract from the text. We use generous whitespace and a strict typographic scale to ensure long-form articles are readable on all devices.

### 2. High Contrast
We use a primary palette of **Red**, **Black**, and **White**. This is not just an aesthetic choice but a functional one, ensuring maximum legibility and accessibility.

### 3. Systematic Consistency
We use **Design Tokens** (CSS Variables) for all spacing, colors, and typography. Use `var(--color-rci-red)` instead of hex codes. This allows us to update the global brand instantly across all applications.

## Elements

### Colors
Our palette is anchored by `RCI Red (#ea1917)`, a vibrant, calling-to-action color, supported by `Black (#000000)` and `Paper White (#ffffff)`.

### Typography
We use a distinct pairing:
*   **Headings**: *Lenin Compressed* – A condensed, impact-heavy font for headlines.
*   **Body**: *Roboto* – A clean, geometric sans-serif for high readability at small sizes.

### Icons
We utilize **Material Symbols Outlined** for UI icons. They provide a clean, modern look that pairs well with Roboto.

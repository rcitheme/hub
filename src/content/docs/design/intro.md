# Design System

The RCI Design System is the single source of truth for our user interface and visual language. It ensures that all our digital products feel like part of the same family.

## Core Elements

### Colors
Our color palette is bold and revolutionary, anchored by our signature red and balanced with a utilitarian neutral scale.

### Typography
We use a distinct typographic scale featuring **Lenin Compressed** for display and **Roboto** for UI, ensuring maximum readability and impact.
